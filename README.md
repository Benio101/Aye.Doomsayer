## Macros
Some useful macros:
```
/raid For newcommers: Find your Doomsayer (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=112527/doomsayer#comments:id=2364213) and cover him with Demon Detection.
/raid Info: Doomsayers was fixed (to have 2nd option) 12.08 01:00 (server time), officially! See blue tracker
```
```
/aye doomsayer
/raid Rule 1: Be able to Demon Detect. Dedicated Addon checks it! Slack/AFK = kick
/raid Rule 2: Every max 15m, check your Doomsayer for 2nd option "There's something not quite right about you…" If you see that, DONT click it; tell on raid!
```
```
/raid Once somebody found 2nd option and raid is ready to kill him, click it and Dread Infiltrator with 16M hp will spawn.
/raid Kill it asap and everybody gets personal chance for a Pocket Fel Spreader toy. Then return to your Doomsayer.
```
